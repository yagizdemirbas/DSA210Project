# DSA210Project  
**Twitter Personal Data Analysis Project**

---

## Motivation  
Twitter activity, such as liking, retweeting, and tweeting, reflects personal interests, engagement patterns, and content preferences. Analyzing this data can provide insights into:  

- The type of content I interact with most frequently.  
- Patterns in my retweets, likes, and original tweets.  
- How my Twitter activity aligns with personal interests, values, or trends over time.  

This project aims to analyze my own Twitter activity to uncover meaningful patterns and trends, helping me better understand my preferences and how I engage with the platform.

## Main Research Questions  
The project will focus on exploring the following questions:  

### Content Preferences  
- What themes or topics dominate the tweets I’ve liked, retweeted, or tweeted?  
- Are there specific accounts or hashtags I engage with frequently?  

### Engagement Trends  
- How has my liking, retweeting, and tweeting activity evolved over time?  
- Are there specific periods of increased or decreased activity?  

### Retweets and Likes Analysis  
- What kind of content am I most likely to retweet or like (e.g., news, humor, educational content)?  
- Are there patterns in the type of accounts I engage with (e.g., verified, niche, personal)?  

### Tweet Analysis  
- What are the most common words, phrases, or hashtags in my tweets?  
- What is the sentiment of my tweets, and how does it change over time?  

### Time-Based Activity  
- At what times or days am I most active on Twitter?  
- Is there a correlation between my activity patterns and the type of content I engage with?

- **Retweets**: Information about tweets I’ve retweeted, including content and original author.  
- **Tweets**: My own tweets, including text, timestamps, and metadata (e.g., hashtags, mentions).
