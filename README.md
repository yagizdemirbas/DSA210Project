**Forecasting and Thematic Analysis of Personal Twitter Activity**

---

## **Motivation**  
Twitter activity, such as liking, retweeting, and tweeting, reflects personal interests, engagement patterns, and evolving trends. Analyzing this data not only uncovers historical patterns but also enables predictions about future behaviors and preferences.  

This project aims to:  
- Analyze my historical Twitter activity to uncover patterns in engagement and content.  
- Develop models to forecast future tweet activity based on temporal trends.  
- Perform sentiment analysis to better understand the tone of my tweets over time.  

This analysis will help better understand my preferences, engagement habits, and future trends in my Twitter activity.

## **Main Research Questions**  

### **Engagement Trends**  
- How has my liking, retweeting, and tweeting activity evolved over time?  
- Are there specific periods of increased or decreased activity?  
- Can I predict future trends in my Twitter engagement (e.g., daily tweet counts)?  

### **Tweet Content and Sentiment**  
- What are the most common themes, topics, or hashtags in my tweets?  
- What is the sentiment of my tweets, and how does it evolve over time?  

### **Time-Based Activity**  
- At what times or days am I most active on Twitter?  
- Is there a correlation between the time of activity and the sentiment of my tweets?

## **Data Source**  
The dataset for this project will be derived from my personal Twitter archive, which includes:  
- **Tweets**: My own tweets, including text, timestamps, and metadata (e.g., hashtags, mentions).  
- **Likes**: Details of tweets I’ve liked, including content, timestamp, and author.  
- **Retweets**: Information on tweets I’ve retweeted, including content and original author.  

This archive provides a comprehensive view of my activity on Twitter and serves as the foundation for analysis and modeling.

## **Project Goals**  

### **1. Engagement Analysis**  
- Explore historical trends in likes, retweets, and tweets to identify engagement patterns over time.  
- Develop metrics to measure activity and interaction frequency.  

### **2. Forecasting Trends**  
- Build time series models to forecast future tweet activity (e.g., daily tweet counts).  
- Identify seasonal or periodic patterns in my Twitter usage.  

### **3. Sentiment Insights**  
- Assess the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of my tweets and analyze its evolution over time.  
- Identify the relationship between sentiment and engagement patterns.  

### **4. Visualizing Patterns**  
- Develop visualizations to highlight temporal trends, engagement statistics, and sentiment analysis results.  

### **5. Future Activity Predictions**  
- Combine sentiment analysis and time series forecasting to predict future activity patterns and sentiment trends.

## **Methodology**  

### **1. Data Preprocessing**  
- Extract data from my Twitter archive.  
- Clean and structure data, ensuring fields like timestamps, content, and metadata are ready for analysis.  
- Categorize data into tweets, likes, and retweets for targeted analysis.  

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Analyze daily and hourly trends in engagement.  
- Generate summary statistics and identify outliers or spikes in activity.  
- Visualize activity trends over time.  

### **3. Sentiment Analysis**  
- Apply sentiment analysis to tweets to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral.  
- Track sentiment over time to detect patterns and trends.  

### **4. Forecasting with Time Series Models**  
- Use ARIMA or advanced models (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) to forecast future activity.  
- Predict daily or hourly tweet counts for the next 7–30 days.  
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE or MAE.  

### **5. Insights and Recommendations**  
- Reflect on the analysis and modeling results to understand how my activity aligns with personal interests.  
- Provide actionable insights for optimizing future engagement or content strategy.
